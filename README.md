##  Project Overview  
This project is part of **ECEN 758: Data Mining and Analysis**.  
We perform **multi-class image classification** on the **Fashion-MNIST dataset**,  
a modern benchmark of 70 000 grayscale clothing images (10 categories).  
The objective is to design, train, and interpret machine-learning models  
that accurately classify fashion items while demonstrating model transparency,  
statistical soundness, and reproducibility.

##  Dataset  
**Fashion-MNIST** by **Zalando Research** serves as a drop-in replacement for MNIST.  
It contains:  
- **60 000 training** + **10 000 test** images  
- **28 × 28 pixels**, grayscale  
- **10 classes:** T-shirt/top, Trouser, Pullover, Dress, Coat, Sandal, Shirt, Sneaker, Bag, Ankle Boot
